## Week 1 - History
- Cuneiform: Wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay
- Babylonian numerals: two types of wedges (10 and 1), base-60
- Egyptian numerals: symbols for powers of 10
- Sumerian language: syllabic writing
- Epic of Gilgamesh approx 4000 yrs ago
- Cylinder seals (Mesopotamia stamping) -> woodblock printing (Diamond Sutra 868AD) -> Gutenberg press (180 luxury Gutenberg Bible copies)
- Typeface = letter design
- Font = collection of typefaces
- Serif/sans serif = fonts with or without strokes
- Upper/lowercase = originated from physical storage cases
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bit = 0 or 1
- Byte = group of 8 bits
- Volatile = temporary (RAM)
- Non-volatile = permanent (HDD)
- Unsigned numbers = from 0-255 for 8 bits
- Signed numbers = from -128-127 for 8 bits
- Fractional numbers = scientific notation with two integers
- ASCII table: maps numbers to characters, 'ASCII codes'
- Control codes = non-printable characters for control functions (newline)
- Text files: interpreted as characters using ASCII
- Binary files: not intended to be read as text
- Punch cards: holes represent bits
- Teleprinters: typed messaged over long distances
## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Titles: \#Title, \##Subtitle
- Italic: \_italic_
- Bold: \**bold**
- Lists: \* or \-
- Rendering: convert from raw to formatted
- Non-alphanumeric: @, \#, $, &, \*
- \ to prevent special interpretation
- JSON: {"key": "value"}, human readable and used for data interchange
- XML: \<tag>value\</tag>, used for data representation
- Unicode: numbers -> characters but allows much larger numbers than ASCII (so more characters too), 'Unicode codepoints'
- UTF-32: 4 bytes, most bytes filled with 0s
- UTF-8: identical to ASCII but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127, most popular encoding
- Unicode written as U+
## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- Vim: comnd line based, requires learning commands, exit command = :q!
- VS: feature rich, extensions and themes available, ctrlD to select multiple occurrences
- IDEs: WebStorm, integrated development environment
- Wildcards: \* for any character sequence
- Regex: for pattern matching, line\d+ finds "line" followed by digits
- Github - customize appearance using themes in _config.yml
## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- Teletype machines connected to computers - commands typed and printed on paper, then replaced by screens
- Advantages to CLI: some functions only in CLI, faster for certain tasks, easier automation through scripting, efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements, minimal resource usage on computers
- CLI cmds: ls (lists files in directory), cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory), cat (display file contents), less (view file contents interactively), cp (copy files), mv (move files), mkdir (create directory), ping (test network connectivity), grep (search text using patterns
- SSH (secure shell): connect to remote computers, CL access
- File transfer: scp (securely copy files between computers), sftp (secure file transfer protocol)
- Interactive tools: htop (monitor system processes and resource usage), tmux (terminal muiltiplexer for managing multiple sessions)
